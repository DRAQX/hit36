# hit36

hit36 is a beginner-friendly **C# WinForms** learning project built to practice core programming concepts and Windows Forms development.

This project was created as my first solo C# experience, with the goal of learning specific topics step-by-step while building a real, working application.

## What I Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals
- General WinForms structure and application flow
- UI design and tool/control modifications
- Creating and managing multiple forms (new windows)
- Adding and using media inside forms (gif)
- Handling mathematical calculations (ensure at least 1 combination to win the game)
- Building simple system/logic structure under the UI

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET (WinForms)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

## Notes

This is not about the simple game you see.
This is an ongoing project for me to practice using GitHub, Git/GitHub workflows, adding features, tracking version changes, experiencing the curve of improving the app to make the best of it.
